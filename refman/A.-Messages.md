The following sections list the warnings and error messages from
`dmlc`, with some clarifications.

## Warning Messages

The messages are listed in alphabetical order; the corresponding tags
are shown within brackets, e.g., `[WNDOC]`.

<dl>
  <dt><b>

... [WSYSTEMC]</b></dt>
  <dd>

SystemC specific warnings
</dd>
  <dt><b>

... [WWRNSTMT]</b></dt>
  <dd>

The source code contained a statement "`warning;`", which
causes a warning to be printed.
</dd>
  <dt><b>

'X then Y' log level has no effect when the levels are the same [WREDUNDANTLEVEL]</b></dt>
  <dd>

`X then Y` log level syntax has no effect when the
first and subsequent levels are the same.
</dd>
  <dt><b>

Comparing negative constant to unsigned integer has a constant result [WNEGCONSTCOMP]</b></dt>
  <dd>

DML uses a special method when comparing an unsigned and signed integer,
meaning that comparing a negative constant to an unsigned integer always
has the same result, which is usually not the intended behaviour.
</dd>
  <dt><b>

Outdated AST file: ... [WOLDAST]</b></dt>
  <dd>

A precompiled DML file has an old time-stamp. This may happen if a
user accidentally edits a DML file from the standard library. A
safe way to suppress the warning is to remove the outdated
`.dmlast` file.
</dd>
  <dt><b>

The assignment source is a constant value which does not fit the assign target of type '...', and will thus be truncated [WASTRUNC]</b></dt>
  <dd>

The source of an assignment is a constant value that can't fit in the
type of the target, and is thus truncated. This warning can be silenced by
explicitly casting the expression to the target type.
</dd>
  <dt><b>

Use of unsupported feature: ... [WEXPERIMENTAL]</b></dt>
  <dd>

This part of the language is experimental, and not yet officially
supported. Code relying on the feature may break without notice in
future releases.
</dd>
  <dt><b>

Use of unsupported feature: ... [WEXPERIMENTAL_UNMAPPED]</b></dt>
  <dd>

This part of the language is experimental, and not yet officially
supported. Code relying on the feature may break without notice in
future releases.
</dd>
  <dt><b>

deprecation: ... [WDEPRECATED]</b></dt>
  <dd>

This part of the language is deprecated, usually because the
underlying support in Simics is deprecated.
</dd>
  <dt><b>

duplicate event checkpoint names: ... [WDUPEVENT]</b></dt>
  <dd>

Two or more events will be checkpointed using the same name, which
means that the checkpoint cannot be safely read back.
</dd>
  <dt><b>

file has no version tag, assuming version 1.2 [WNOVER]</b></dt>
  <dd>

A DML file must start with a version statement, such as `dml 1.2;`
</dd>
  <dt><b>

implementation of ...() without 'is ...' is ignored by the standard library [WNOIS]</b></dt>
  <dd>

Many standard method overrides will only be recognized if a
template named like the method is also instantiated. For instance,
the method `set` in a field has no effect unless the
`set` template is instantiated.
</dd>
  <dt><b>

negative register offset: <i>N</i> [WNEGOFFS]</b></dt>
  <dd>

A negative integer expression is given as a register offset.
Register offsets are unsigned 64-bit numbers, which means that
a negative offset expression translates to a very large offset.
</dd>
  <dt><b>

no 'desc' parameter specified for device [WNSHORTDESC]</b></dt>
  <dd>

No short description string was specified using the 'desc' parameter.
(This warning is disabled by default.)
</dd>
  <dt><b>

no documentation for '...' [WNDOC]</b></dt>
  <dd>

No documentation string was specified for the attribute.
(This warning is disabled by default.)
</dd>
  <dt><b>

no documentation for required attribute '...' [WNDOCRA]</b></dt>
  <dd>

No documentation string was specified for a _required_ attribute.
</dd>
  <dt><b>

overriding non-throwing DML 1.4 method with throwing DML 1.2 method [WTHROWS_DML12]</b></dt>
  <dd>

In DML 1.2, a method is by default permitted to throw an exception,
while in DML 1.4, an annotation `throws` is required for that.
So, if a method without annotations is ported to DML 1.4, it will
no longer permit exceptions. If such method is overridden by
a DML 1.2 file, then a non-throwing method is overridden by a potentially
throwing method, which is normally a type error. However, this particular
case is reduced to this warning. If an exception is uncaught in the
override, then this will automatically be caught in runtime and
an error message will be printed.
</dd>
  <dt><b>

potential leak of confidential information [WCONFIDENTIAL]</b></dt>
  <dd>

The object's name/qname is used as part of an expression in a
context other than the log statement, which could potentially lead
to the leak of confidential information.
</dd>
  <dt><b>

prefer 'is' statement outside template braces, 'template ... is (x, y) {' [WTEMPLATEIS]</b></dt>
  <dd>

In a template with methods marked `shared`, it is recommended that
other templates are instantiated on the same line
</dd>
  <dt><b>

shifting away all data [WSHALL]</b></dt>
  <dd>

The result of the shift operation will always be zero.
(This warning is disabled by default.)
</dd>
  <dt><b>

sizeof on a type is not legal, use sizeoftype instead [WSIZEOFTYPE]</b></dt>
  <dd>

The 'sizeof' operator is used on a type name, but expects an
expression. Use the 'sizeoftype' operator for types.
</dd>
  <dt><b>

the time value of type '...' is implicitly converted to the type '...' expected by the specified time unit '...'. [WTTYPEC]</b></dt>
  <dd>

The delay value provided to an `after` call is subject to
implicit type conversion which may be unexpected for certain types.
To silence this warning, explicitly cast the delay value to the expected
type.
</dd>
  <dt><b>

unused implementation of DML 1.2 method ...; enclose in #if (dml_1_2) ? [WUNUSED_DML12]</b></dt>
  <dd>

A DML 1.4 file contains a method implementation that would override
a library method in DML 1.2, but which is not part of the DML 1.4
library, because some methods have been renamed. For instance,
implementing `read_access` in a register makes no sense
in DML 1.4, because the method has been renamed to
`read_register`.

If a DML 1.4 file contains common code that also is imported from
DML 1.2 devices, then it may need to implement methods like
`read_access` to get the right callbacks when compiled
for DML 1.2. Such implementations can be placed inside `#if
(dml_1_2) { }` blocks to avoid this warning.
</dd>
  <dt><b>

unused parameter ... contains ... [WREF]</b></dt>
  <dd>

An unused parameter refers to an object that has not been declared.

This warning message will be replaced with a hard error in future
major versions of Simics.
</dd>
  <dt><b>

unused: ... [WUNUSED]</b></dt>
  <dd>

The object is not referenced anywhere.
(This warning is disabled by default.; it typically causes many false
warnings.)
</dd>
  <dt><b>

unused: ... methods are not called automatically for ... objects in ... [WUNUSEDDEFAULT]</b></dt>
  <dd>

The object is not referenced anywhere but it matches a name of an
object automatically referenced in another scope. This is the same
as WUNUSED but only for known common errors and it will never be
emitted if WUNUSED is enabled.
</dd>
</dl>


## Error Messages

The messages are listed in alphabetical order; the corresponding tags
are shown within brackets, e.g., `[ENBOOL]`.

<dl>
  <dt><b>

... [EERRSTMT]</b></dt>
  <dd>

The source code contained a statement "`error;`", which
forces a compilation error with the given message, or the standard message
"forced compilation error in source code".
</dd>
  <dt><b>

... in template ... does not belong to the template type [ENSHARED]</b></dt>
  <dd>

If a template provides an object that is not accessible from shared
methods, such as an untyped parameter or a non-shared method, then
that object's name is reserved within the scope of the shared
method.  I.e., if a shared method tries to access a symbol that
isn't accessible, then ENSHARED is reported, even before looking
for the symbol in the global scope. Section
[x](3.-Device-Modeling-Language,-version-1.4#shared-methods) describes which template symbols
are accessible from a shared method.
</dd>
  <dt><b>

'...' has no member named '...' [EMEMBER]</b></dt>
  <dd>

Attempt to access a nonexisting member of a compound data structure.
</dd>
  <dt><b>

'.len' cannot be used with variable-length arrays [EVLALEN]</b></dt>

</dd>
  <dt><b>

Ambiguous invocation of default implementation [EAMBDEFAULT]</b></dt>
  <dd>

A method may not invoke its default implementation if multiple
methods are overridden, and the template inheritance graph is
insufficient to infer that one default implementation overrides
the others. See section [x](3.-Device-Modeling-Language,-version-1.4#calling-methods) for details.
</dd>
  <dt><b>

Cannot declare '...' variable in an inline method [ESTOREDINLINE]</b></dt>

</dd>
  <dt><b>

Declaration would result in conflicting attribute name [EATTRCOLL]</b></dt>
  <dd>

This error is signalled if two DML declarations would result in two
Simics attributes being registered with the same name.

This most commonly happens when an attribute name is a result of the
object hierarchy, and there is another object named similarly. For example,
if a bank contains one register named `g_r` and
a group `g` containing a register named `r`.

the end of the method. Either an explicit value must be returned
in a return statement, or the execution must be aborted by an
exception or assertion failure. Note that DMLC's control flow

uncaught exception in call to DML 1.2 method '...' [EBADFAIL_dml12]</b></dt>
  <dd>

If a DML 1.2 method lacks a `nothrow` annotation, and a
non-throwing DML 1.4 method calls it, then DMLC will analyze
whether the method call can actually cause an exception. If it
can, this error is reported; if not, the call is permitted.

For this error, a 1.2 method counts as throwing if it throws an
exception, or calls a `throws` marked 1.4 method, or
(recursively) if it invokes a method that counts as throwing. A
call or throw statement inside a `try` block does not cause
the method to count as throwing. The methods
`attribute.set`, `bank.read_access` and
`bank.write_access` count as throwing even if they don't
throw.

This error is normally reported while porting common DML 1.2 code
to DML 1.4: most 1.2 methods are not meant to throw exceptions,
and when converted to DML 1.4 this becomes a strict requirement
unless the method is annotated with the `throws` keyword.
The remedy for this error message is normally to insert a
`try` block around some call along the throwing call chain,
with a `catch` block that handles the exception
gracefully. The `try` block should usually be as close as
possible to the `throw` in the call chain.
