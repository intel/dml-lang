This chapter describes the standard templates included the
Device Modeling Language (DML)
library. The templates can be used for both registers and fields. The
templates can be accessed after importing `utility.dml`.

The most common device register functionality is included in the
standard templates.

Note that many standard templates has the same functionality and only
differ by name or log-messages printed when writing or reading
them. The name of the template help developers to get a quick overview
of the device functionality. An example are the *undocumented*
and *reserved* templates. Both have the same
functionality. However, the *undocumented* template hints that
something in the device documentation is unclear or missing, and the
*reserved* template that the register or field should not be used
by software.

The sub-sections use *object* as a combined name for registers
and fields. The sub-sections refers to software and hardware reads and
writes. Software reads and writes are defined as accesses using the
`io_memory` interface (write/reads to memory/io mapped
device). Software reads and writes use the DML built-in read and write
methods. Hardware read writes are defined as accesses using Simics
configuration attributes, using the DML built-in set and get
methods. Device code can still modify a register or device even if
hardware modification is prohibited.

## Templates for reset

Reset behavior can vary quite a bit between different devices. DML
has no built-in support for handling reset, but there are standard
templates in `utility.dml` to cover some common reset
  mechanisms.

  There are three standard reset types:

<dl><dt>

Power-on reset
</dt><dd>

The reset that happens when power is
first supplied to a device.
</dd><dt>

Hard reset
</dt><dd>

Typically triggered by a physical hard
reset line that can be controlled from various sources, such as
a watchdog timer or a physical button. Often the same as a
power-on reset.
</dd><dt>

Soft reset
</dt><dd>

This usually refers to a reset induced by
software, e.g. by a register write. Not all devices have a soft
reset, and some systems may support more than one type of soft
reset.
</dd></dl>

  Usually, the effect of a reset is that all registers are restored to
  some pre-defined value.

  In DML, the reset types can be enabled by instantiating the
  templates `poreset`, `hreset`
  and `sreset`, respectively. These will define a port with the
  corresponding upper-case name
  (`POWER`, `HRESET`, `SRESET`), which implements
  the `signal` interface, triggering the corresponding
  reset type on raising edge. This happens by invoking a corresponding
  method (`power_on_reset`, `hard_reset`
  and `soft_reset`, respectively), in all
  objects implementing a given template
  (`power_on_reset`, `hard_reset`
  and `soft_reset`, respectively). The default is that all
  registers and fields implement these templates, with the default
  behavior being to restore to the value of the `init_val` parameter.

  The default implementation of all reset methods recursively calls
  the corresponding reset method in all sub-objects. Thus, if a reset
  method is overridden in an object without
  calling `default()`, then reset is effectively suppressed in
  all sub-objects.

  The two most common overrides of reset behavior are:

* to reset to a different value. In the general case, this can
  be done with an explicit method override. In the case of soft
  reset, you can also use the standard
  template `soft_reset_val` which allows you to configure
  the reset value with a parameter `soft_reset_val`.


* to suppress reset. This can be done with a standard
  template: `sticky` suppresses soft reset only,
  while `no_reset` suppresses all resets.

  It is quite common that hard reset and power-on reset behave
  identically. In this case, we recommend that only a `HRESET` port is
  created; this way, the presence of a `POWER` port is an indication
  that the device actually provides a distinct behavior on power cycling.

  There are some less common reset use cases:

* In some devices, the standard reset types may not map well to
  the hardware, typically because there may be more than one reset
  type that could be viewed as a soft reset. In this case, we
  recommend that `SRESET` is replaced with device-specific port
  names that map better to the hardware, but that the `POWER` and
  `HRESET` port names are preserved if they are unambiguous.

* In some cases, it is desirable to accurately simulate how a
  device acts in a powered-off state. This would typically mean
  that the device does not react to other stimuli until power is
  turned on again.

  The recommended way to simulate a powered-off state, is to let the
  high signal level of the `POWER` port represent that the device has
  power, and react as if power is down while the signal is
  low. Furthermore, the device is reset when the `POWER` signal is
  lowered.

  If this scheme is used by a device, then a device will be considered
  turned off after instantiation, so the `POWER` signal must be raised
  explicitly before the device can function normally.

  Thus, there are two rather different ways to handle devices that
  have a `POWER` port:

  * `POWER` can be treated as a pure reset port, which stays low for
    most of the time and is rapidly raised and lowered to mark a
    power-on reset. This is the most convenient way to provide a power
    signal, but it only works if the device only uses `POWER` for
    power-on reset. If the device models power supply accurately, then
    it will not function as expected, because it will consider power
    to be off.

  * `POWER` can be accurately treated as a power supply, meaning that
    the signal is raised before simulation starts, and lowered when
    power goes down. A reset is triggered by a lower followed by a
    raise. This approach is less convenient to implement, but more
    correct: The device will function correctly both if the device
    does an accurate power supply simulation, and if it only uses
    `POWER` for power-on reset.


### power\_on\_reset, hard\_reset, soft\_reset

<section>

#### Description

Implemented on any
object to get a callback on the corresponding reset event.  Automatically
implemented by registers and fields.

#### Related Templates

poreset, hreset, sreset

</section>

### poreset, hreset, sreset

<section>

#### Description

Implemented on the top level to get standard reset behaviour,
for power-on reset, hard reset and soft reset, respectively.

#### Related Templates

power\_on\_reset, hard\_reset, soft\_reset

</section>

## Templates for registers and fields

The following templates can be applied to both registers and fields.  Most of
them affect either the write or read operation; if applied on a register it
will disregard fields. For instance, when applying the `read_unimpl` template
on a register with fields, then the read will ignore any implementations of
`read` or `read_field` in fields, and return the current register value
(through `get`), ignoring any `read` overrides in fields. However, writes will
still propagate to the fields.

### soft\_reset\_val

<section>

#### Description

Implemented on a register or field. Upon soft reset, the reset value is
defined by the required `soft_reset_val` parameter,
instead of the default `init_val`.

#### Related Templates

soft\_reset

</section>

### ignore\_write

<section>

#### Description

Writes are ignored. This template might also be useful for read-only
fields inside an otherwise writable register. See the documentation for the
`read_only` template for more information.

#### Log Output

None.

</section>

### read\_zero

<section>

#### Description

Reads return 0, regardless of register/field value. Writes are
unaffected by this template.

#### Log Output

None.

</section>

### read\_only

<section>

#### Description

The object value is read-only for software, the object value can be
modified by hardware.

#### Log Output

First software write results in a spec\_violation log-message on
log-level 1, remaining writes on log-level 2. Fields will only log if the
written value is different from the old value.

If the register containing the read-only field also contains writable fields,
it may be better to use the ignore\_write template instead, since software
often do not care about what gets written to a read-only field, causing
unnecessary logging.

</section>

### write\_only

<section>

#### Description

The register value can be modified by software but can't be read back, reads
return 0. Only for use on registers; use `read_zero` for write-only
fields.

#### Log Output

The first time the object is read there is a spec\_violation
log-message on log-level 1, remaining reads on log-level 2.

</section>

### write\_1\_clears

<section>

#### Description

Software can only clear bits. This feature is often used when
hardware sets bits and software clears them to acknowledge.
Software write 1's to clear bits. The new object value is
a bitwise AND of the old object value and the bitwise
complement of the value written by software.

#### Log Output

None.

</section>

### clear\_on\_read

<section>

#### Description

Software reads return the object value. The object value is then reset to 0
as a side-effect of the read.

#### Log Output

None.

</section>

### write\_1\_only

<section>

#### Description

Software can only set bits to 1.
The new object value is the bitwise OR of the
old object value and the value written by software.

#### Log Output

None.

#### Related Templates

write\_0\_only

</section>

### write\_0\_only

<section>

#### Description

Software can only set bits to 0.
The new object value is the bitwise AND of the
old object value and the value written by software.

#### Log Output

None.

#### Related Templates

write\_1\_only

</section>

### read\_constant

<section>

#### Description

Reads return a constant value.

Writes are unaffected by this template. The read value is unaffected
by the value of the register or field.

#### Log Output

None.

#### Parameters

read\_val: the constant value

#### Related Templates

constant, silent\_constant

</section>

### constant

<section>

#### Description

Writes are forbidden and have no effect.

The object still has backing storage, which affects the value being read.
Thus, an end-user can modify the constant value by writing to the register's
attribute. Such tweaks will survive a reset.

Using the `constant` template marks that the object is intended to
stay constant, so the model should not update the register value, and not
override the `read` method. Use the template
`read_only` if that is desired.

#### Log Output

First write to register or field (if field value is not
equal to write value) results in a spec\_violation log-message on
log-level 1, remaining writes on log-level 2.

#### Parameters

init\_val: the constant value

#### Related Templates

read\_constant, silent\_constant,
read\_only

</section>

### silent\_constant

<section>

#### Description

The object value will remain constant.
Writes are ignored and do not update the object value.

The end-user can tweak the constant value; any tweaks will survive a reset.

By convention, the object value should not be modified by the model; if that
behaviour is wanted, use the `ignore_write` template instead.

#### Log Output

None.

#### Parameters

init\_val: the constant value

#### Related Templates

constant, read\_constant

</section>

### zeros

<section>

#### Description

The object value is constant 0.
Software writes are forbidden and do not update the object value.

#### Log Output

First software write to register or field (if field value is not
equal to write value) results in a spec\_violation log-message on
log-level 1, remaining writes on log-level 2.

</section>

### ones

<section>

#### Description

The object is constant all 1's.
Software writes do not update the object value. The
object value is all 1's.

#### Log Output

First software write to register or field (if field value is not
equal to write value) results in a spec\_violation log-message on
log-level 1, remaining writes on log-level 2.

</section>

### ignore

equal to write value) results in a spec\_violation log-message on
log-level 2. No logs on subsequent writes.

</section>

### unimpl

<section>

#### Description

The object functionality is unimplemented. Warn when software is using the
object. Writes and reads are implemented as default writes and reads.

#### Log Output

First read from a register results in an unimplemented log-message on
log-level 1, remaining reads on log-level 3. Reads from a field does
not result in a log-message. First write to a register results in
an unimplemented log-message on log-level 1, remaining writes on log-level 3.
First write to a field (if field value is not equal to write value) results

access is using default implementation and can be overridden (for instance
by the read\_only template).

#### Log Output

First software read to a register results in an unimplemented log-message on
log-level 1, remaining reads on log-level 3. Software reads to fields does
not result in a log-message.

access is using default implementation and can be overridden (for instance
by the write\_only template).

#### Log Output

First software write to registers results in an unimplemented log-message on
log-level 1, remaining writes on log-level 3.  First write to a field (if
field value is not equal to write value) results in an unimplemented

reads.

#### Log Output

First software write and read result in a spec\_violation log-message on
log-level 1, remaining on log-level 2.

</section>

### design\_limitation

<section>

#### Description

The object's functionality is not in the model's scope and has been
left unimplemented as a design decision. Software and hardware
writes and reads are implemented as default writes and reads.
Debug registers are a prime example of when to use this
template. This is different from *unimplemented* which is
intended to be implement (if required) but is a limitation in
the current model.

#### Related Templates

unimplemented,
silent\_unimplemented

</section>

### no\_reset

<section>

#### Description

The register's or field's value will not be changed on a hard or soft reset.

</section>

## Bank related templates

### function\_mapped\_bank

<section>

#### Description

Only valid in `bank` objects. The bank is recognized as a function mapped
bank by the `function_io_memory` template, and is mapped to a specified
function by whoever instantiates that template.

#### Parameters

function: the function number, an integer

#### Related Templates

function\_io\_memory

</section>

### function\_io\_memory

<section>

#### Description

Only valid in `implement` objects named
`io_memory`. Implements the `io_memory` interface by
function mapping: An incoming memory transaction is handled by finding a
bank that instantiates the `function_mapped_bank` template, and has a
function number that matches the memory transaction's. If such a bank
exists, the transaction is handled by that bank. If no such bank exists, an
error message is logged and a miss is reported for the access.

Mapping banks by function number is a deprecated practice, still used by PCI
devices for legacy reasons. It is usually easier to
map a bank directly into a memory space, than using a function number as an
indirection.

Note also that function numbers as defined by the PCI standard are unrelated
to the function numbers of banks. They can sometimes coincide, though.

#### Parameters

function: the function number, an integer

#### Related Templates

function\_mapped\_bank

</section>

### miss\_pattern\_bank

<section>

#### Description

Only valid in `bank` objects. Handles unmapped accesses by
ignoring write accesses, and returning a given value for each unmapped
byte.

#### Parameters

miss\_pattern: each missed byte in a miss read is set to this value

</section>

## Connect related templates

### map\_target

A `connect` object can instantiate the template `map_target`. The template
provides an easy way to send memory transactions to objects that can be
mapped into Simics memory maps. It defines a default implementation of
`validate` which verifies that the object can be used to create a map
target, i.e. the Simics API `SIM_new_map_target` returns a valid
pointer. The template provides a session variable `map_target` of the type
`map_target_t *` which can be used to issue transactions to the connected
object.

The template defines the following methods:

* `read(uint64 addr, uint64 size) -> (uint64) throws`

  Reads `size` bytes starting at `addr` in the connected object. Size
  must be 8 or less. Byte order is little-endian. Throws an exception if
  the read fails.
     
* `read_bytes(uint64 addr, uint64 size, uint8 *bytes) throws`

  Reads `size` bytes into `bytes`, starting at `addr` in the connected
  object. Throws an exception if the read fails.
    
* `write(uint64 addr, uint64 size, uint64 value) throws`

  Writes `value` of `size` bytes, starting at `addr` in the connected
  object. Size must be 8 or less. Byte order is little-endian. Throws an
  exception if the write fails.
    
* `write_bytes(uint64 addr, uint64 size, const uint8 *bytes) throws`

  Writes `size` bytes from `bytes`, starting at `addr` in the connected
  object. Throws an exception if the write fails.
    
* `issue(transaction_t *t, uint64 addr) -> (exception_type_t)`

  Provides a shorthand to the API function `SIM_issue_transaction`.
  This method is called by the read/write methods in this template. It
  can be overridden, e.g. to add additional atoms to the transactions,
  while still allowing the ease-of-use from the simpler methods.
